You are to design a thermometer with a web interface. The “design” is a set of documents that describe how to make this device. Accompanying this design is a prototype that demonstrates that the design works.  
This design must satisfy a set of exacting requirements, as laid out in this document. Some of these requirements specify the expected functionality and performance of the design and some are mechanical specifications. The primary challenge of this project is to analyze the requirements carefully and create and implement a design that satisfies all of them.  As you read through this document, you may experience some uncertainty about the meaning or interpretation of certain requirements.  It is important that you get all such uncertainties clarified before you finalize your design. 


## Requirements:

1.	General Description: This device consists of four separate assemblies:  
- A computer (PC or other desktop or laptop) used for user interface, display, and control. 
-	A thermometer sensor, at the end of a 2.0 +-0.1 meter cable. This should be a nice mechanical construction, capable of bouncing around without breaking. The sensor should not be damaged when placed in ice water. 
-	A third box containing, at minimum, a display (e.g. a set of 7-segment LEDs or equivalent), a button, a battery, and a power switch. It is intended that the box, together with the sensor, can act as a battery-operated thermometer. The temperature data is then available on the internet. 
-	A cellphone that can receive text messages
